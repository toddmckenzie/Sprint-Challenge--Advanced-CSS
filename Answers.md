1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

  The both use media querys but responsive uses repsonsive units and it accomodates 1000s of devices and takes much longer to build.  
  Adaptive just uses breakpoints.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

  Mobile first would mean to code for the mobile first and work your way up to the desktop.  This is the preferred route but is not always taken.  You would use min-width for breakpoints.  
  Desktop first would be the complete opposite.   Code for desktop and work way down to mobile.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

  62.5% really just makes it easier to use rems.  1 rem would then be equal to 10px font-size so its much easier to do the math that way than using 100% font-size which would equate to 16px.  If you want 16px you would use 1.6rem.
  Easier and quicker....

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

  A way to get out of using standard CSS coding by using something like LESS which allows you to do things that CSS doesn't allow.  Nesting, functions, mixins and other things that allows for easier and faster CSS to be produced.
  A compiler takes your code and compiles it into CSS.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

  I like nesting the best.  Its much easier and faster to find what you are looking for.  The concept that gives me the most trouble is probably mixins and parametric mixins.  Its not that I don't understand them, its that I haven't really seen a necessity to use them.
